Rust Practice: Basic Rust Concepts

This repository provides a basic overview of Rust programming 
principles.  It covers fundamental concepts such as data types, 
control flow, and basic syntax.

**Prerequisites:**

*   **Basic Rust Knowledge:** Familiarity with Rust concepts like 
`main` function, `unsafe` keyword, and basic memory management is 
required.
*   **Understanding of Data Types:**  A basic understanding of data 
types (character, integer, boolean, etc.) and their properties is 
helpful.
*   **Understanding of Control Flow:**  Understanding how programs 
execute instructions, using `if`, `else`, and `for` loops.

**Concepts Covered:**

*   **Data Types:**  Primitives (character, integer, boolean, etc.) 
and their properties.
*   **Control Flow:**  `if`, `else`, `for`, `while` loops.
*   **Memory Management:**  `malloc`, `free`, `new`, `delete`.
*   **Basic Syntax:**  Basic syntax for defining a program 
(variables, operators, keywords).
*   **Error Handling:**  `try`, `catch`, `throw` blocks.
*   **Functions:**  Defining and calling functions.
